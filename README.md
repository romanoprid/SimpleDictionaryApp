Here is an app when you can find some words, their definition etc. 
On the first screen you can search for some words, just input your word from your imagination to the field and click the search button, you should see something like this:

After that click one of the shown words (in this situation only one word will be shown) and you will be navigated to the another screen where you can see definition of the word and some sentences with it (task with a star find the difference between sponge bob at the home screen and on the description one :) ):

If you will leave search field at the home screen or input some random letters you will get an error:
